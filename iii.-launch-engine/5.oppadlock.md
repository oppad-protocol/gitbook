# 5.OPPADLock

_Secure liquidity. Build trust. Launch safely._

**OPPADLock** is OPPAD’s built-in liquidity locking module that ensures developers **cannot pull liquidity** after a launch — one of the most common rugpull tactics in DeFi.

By enforcing time-locked liquidity, OPPADLock gives investors **visible, on-chain proof** that the project’s core funds are safe for a specific period.

#### 🧾 Lock Setup Flow

To initiate a lock:

1. Select the blockchain (ETH, BNB, Solana, Base, Sonic)
2. Input your **token contract address**
3. Enter the **amount of tokens or LP tokens** to lock
4. Choose a **locking duration** (in days)
5. Click **Lock Liquidity**

Once confirmed in your wallet, your lock is live and indexed to:

* **My Locks**: Private wallet dashboard
* **All Locks**: Public global explorer

***

> \[!INFO]\
> You must use the **same wallet that created or applied for the project** to lock liquidity. This enforces ownership alignment and reduces impersonation.

***

#### 🔍 Transparency View

Each lock record contains:

* Token name, symbol, and address
* Wallet address
* Chain
* Lock date and unlock date
* Amount locked
* Status (Active, Withdrawn)
* TX hash (with block explorer link)

This is all publicly displayed in the **“All Locks”** section of the platform, keeping the ecosystem transparent and traceable.

***

#### 🧠 Use Cases

* Lock LP tokens from a **Presale or Fairlaunch**
* Lock team or marketing tokens for vesting
* Publicly verify token safety for stealth launches
* Combine with badges (Audit + KYC + Lock) for full trust profile

> \[!TIP]\
> All OPPAD launch modes require liquidity to be locked before launch. The lock timer must exceed the launch duration.
