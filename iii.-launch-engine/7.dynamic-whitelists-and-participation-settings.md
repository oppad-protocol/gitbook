# 7.Dynamic Whitelists & Participation Settings

_Flexible access control. Fair for all._

OPPAD allows projects to define **custom participation rules** across all launch types — without needing technical skills. Whether you want a fully open launch or a limited whitelist for early backers, everything is configurable through the UI.

***

#### 🔓 Tierless by Default

Unlike traditional launchpads that restrict access based on staking tiers or insider groups, OPPAD is **open by design**:

* All launch modes (Presale, Fairlaunch, Stealth, O-Pump) start with **unrestricted participation**
* No token gate or tier is required to contribute
* Access is determined by the launch configuration, not staking level

✅ This ensures **equal opportunity** for all investors

***

#### 📜 Whitelist Control (Optional)

Projects can enable optional whitelisting in their launch configuration:

* Upload a list of wallet addresses via CSV
* Set a whitelist-only period (e.g., first 5 minutes)
* Allow whitelist to expire and open access to the public
* Track whitelist eligibility via dashboard integration

✅ Great for rewarding early supporters\
🔐 Protects against bot domination during early seconds of the sale

#### ⚙️ Contribution Rules

You can also configure contribution limits to control buying power:

| Option            | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Min Buy**       | Minimum amount required to participate         |
| **Max Buy**       | Maximum amount a wallet can contribute         |
| **Cooldowns**     | Delay between multiple contributions           |
| **Access Rounds** | Sequential open periods (e.g., Early → Public) |

> \[!INFO]\
> These settings apply per wallet and are enforced **on-chain** — not just through the frontend.

***

#### 🛡️ Anti-Bot Protection

Even with open access, OPPAD includes safeguards to prevent abuse:

* Rate limiting
* Gas cap detection
* Optional block delay
* Max TX per block
* Optional bot flagging for rapid-fire wallets

> \[!TIP]\
> These protections are strongest in **O-Pump Mode™**, but available to all launch types via the admin panel.

***

With these tools, you can strike the perfect balance between **community-first access** and **security-driven controls** — without sacrificing speed or fairness.
