# 3.Stealth Launch

_Low-key. High-speed. Community-first._

**Stealth Launch Mode** allows you to deploy and list your token without prior public promotion or presale participation. This mode is ideal for projects that want a **surprise launch**, viral momentum, or meme-token energy — while still retaining full liquidity locks and credibility controls.

#### 🧾 Step 1: Basic Information

_Submit your core project and identity details._

Required fields:

* Blockchain selection (ETH, BNB, Solana, Base, Sonic)
* Contact info (name, email, Telegram)
* Project logo (300x300px)
* Project name + description
* Website, whitepaper, socials, GitHub

> \[!INFO]\
> Even though the launch is stealth, **your project profile must be complete and visible** to meet OPPAD’s transparency standards.

***

#### ⚙️ Step 2: Configuration

_Set your stealth parameters and liquidity plan._

Key configuration fields:

* Listing type (DEX choice)
* Liquidity %
* Launch start & end time
* Lock duration (e.g. 30 days)

Unlike presales and fairlaunches, **no soft or hard caps** are used — stealth launches rely on token listing and organic community traction.

> \[!TIP]\
> OPPAD enforces **minimum liquidity requirements and lock periods** even in stealth mode.

#### 🔐 Step 3: Final Settings

_Enable transparency, trust, and protection._

Security options:

* KYC status
* Audit completion
* Doxxed team flag
* Incubation request
* Refund policy
* Additional external links

Submit your stealth project for internal review. Once approved, it becomes eligible for AegisAI™ and Sentinel scoring — just like other launch modes — but remains **off-list until you go live**.

***

> \[!WARNING]\
> Stealth launches without KYC or audit **will be flagged visually** on the dashboard, but are still allowed as long as liquidity is locked.
