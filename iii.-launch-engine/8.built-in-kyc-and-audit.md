# 8.Built-in KYC & Audit

_Automated trust verification — fully integrated and secure._

OPPAD offers a seamless, built-in process for both **KYC (Know Your Customer)** verification and **Smart Contract Auditing**. These two layers of validation help protect the community and elevate trustworthy projects by making transparency the default.

#### 🔐 KYC Verification

_Verify your identity to gain the KYC badge and improve investor trust._

OPPAD’s KYC process is secure, compliant, and intuitive. It takes just a few minutes and consists of 3 steps:

1. **Choose your region & identity type**\
    - Passport, National ID, or Driving License\

3. **Enter personal details**\
    - Name, address, city, postal code\
   \
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

> \[!TIP]\
> Your KYC data is **never shared publicly**. Only a badge is issued after validation.

✅ Once complete, you receive the **KYC Badge** on your project profile\
🔒 Verified identities are reviewed and stored securely with no on-chain exposure

#### 🧪 Smart Contract Audit

_Submit your token’s source code and get it reviewed before launch._\

You can request a smart contract audit directly from your dashboard by filling in:

* Project Name
* Token Name & Symbol
* Contract Description
* Target Chain
* Upload the `.sol` file (Solidity source)

Once submitted:

* Your contract will be reviewed by **AegisAI™** and **Sentinel Team**
* You will receive a risk score and findings summary
* Projects with valid external audit reports can also submit them for verification

> \[!INFO]\
> Only projects with a validated audit (internal or external) receive the **Audit Badge.**

***

#### 📜 Submitted Audits Dashboard

After requesting, your audit appears under **Submitted Audits** with:

* Status: Pending / Approved / Flagged
* Review Score
* Badge status (auto-assigned once approved)

> \[!WARNING]\
> All launch modes (Presale, Fairlaunch, O-Pump) **must complete audit review before token is public**.
