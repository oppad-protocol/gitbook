# 2.Fairlaunch

_No tiers. No whitelists. Just a fair, open token launch for all._

Fairlaunch Mode allows projects to raise capital through a **time-based, permissionless sale** where all users have equal opportunity to participate. There are **no whitelists** or early insider advantages — making it the fairest way to distribute tokens publicly.
