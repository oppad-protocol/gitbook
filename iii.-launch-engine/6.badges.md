# 6.Badges

_Visual proof of trust. Transparent, earned, and on-chain._

In a permissionless launch environment, **badges act as a trust layer** between project teams and the community. Every project on OPPAD can earn one or more badges, which are displayed prominently on the launch card, project page, and contract listing.

Badges are **granted based on verified actions**, and once assigned, they are **stored on-chain and cannot be altered** by the project team.

#### 🔐 KYC Badge

**“Identity Verified”**

* Assigned when a project’s team completes identity verification via a recognized KYC provider.
* OPPAD manually approves the verification before issuing the badge.
* Especially important for high-cap or long-term projects.

📍 Visible on launch dashboard and detailed page

#### 🔍 Audit Badge

**“Smart Contract Audited”**

To earn this badge, a project must provide one of the following:

* ✅ A full **contract audit report from an external auditing firm** (e.g. Certik, HashEx, Solidity Finance)
