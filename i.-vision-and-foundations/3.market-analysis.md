#### 💣 Broken Models Still Dominate

Despite the proliferation of launchpads, most platforms still fall short:

* ✅ **One-click token creation** exists
* ❌ But **real auditing** is rare
* ❌ Most use **tier-gated access** favoring early whales
* ❌ No post-launch growth tools (staking, farming, KOL support)
* ❌ Centralized curation, opaque listings
