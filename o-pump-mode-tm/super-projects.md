# Super Projects

_Verified. Ranked. Promoted._

The **Super Projects** section is a curated space within OPPAD’s O-Pump Mode™ designed to **highlight high-quality launches**, prioritize visibility for trusted builders, and showcase top-performing developers.

Unlike the general pool of pump-style projects, Super Projects are:

* 🧾 **Verified by the team**
* 📈 **Scored by performance and quality**
* 🚀 **Promoted across the dashboard**

***

#### 🌟 Featured Project

At the top of the Super Projects board, OPPAD highlights **one project per cycle** that represents the best mix of hype, trust, and technical execution.

Selection is based on:

* Highest score in launch metrics
* Verified dev reputation
* Community activity & on-chain traction

***

#### 🛠️ Verified Dev Projects

Projects in this section are launched by developers who have earned **Verified Developer** status. These are builders who:

* Have **launched multiple safe tokens**
* Show clean audit history

* Are listed in the **Top Devs Leaderboard**

Each verified project displays:

* Project card with score (out of 100)

#### 🧑‍💻 Top Devs Leaderboard
