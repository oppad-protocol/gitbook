# 3.Safety First

_Not just fast — secure by design._

While most stealth or meme-token platforms prioritize hype and ignore risk, **O-Pump Mode™ is built with security as a core layer**, not an afterthought. Every part of the system — from token minting to LP migration — is engineered to prevent rugpulls, exploits, and dishonest behavior.

***

#### 🔒 1. Liquidity Locking (Mandatory)

Unlike traditional stealth launches where devs can remove LP at any time, **O-Pump requires that all liquidity is either:**

* **Burned** (irreversibly removed)
* **Timelocked** (with a visible unlock date)

✅ Prevents rugpulls\
✅ LP ownership is fully transparent\
✅ Lock status is displayed publicly

***

#### 🧮 2. Curve-Based Pricing = No Manual Control

The **Power Ramp algorithm** replaces manual pricing with math:

* No one can change the token price mid-sale
* No “price manipulation” or manual cap increases
* Each buyer receives tokens based on a predictable, verified formula

✅ Pricing is consistent for everyone\
✅ Prevents insider abuse or admin edits

***

#### 🧑‍💻 3. Verified Developer System

Projects with KYC-completed creators receive the **Verified Developer Badge**, which:

* Confirms identity is on record with OPPAD
* Unlocks access to **Super Projects**
* Ranks the project higher in dashboards
* Helps filter out anonymous scam attempts

✅ Builds confidence without doxxing publicly\
✅ Visible next to the token across all views

***

#### 🔁 4. On-Chain Migration Logic

The **automatic `migration()` function** is built into the smart contract:

* Triggered only after a fixed supply threshold (e.g., 20%)
* Deploys LP and finalizes listing without manual dev actions
* Enforces LP lock in the same transaction

✅ No manual listing risks\
✅ Can’t be skipped or modified post-deployment
