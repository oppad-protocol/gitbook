# 1.What is O-Pump?

_A safer evolution of pump.fun — designed for speed, built for security._

**O-Pump Mode™** is OPPAD’s high-energy, on-chain launch engine optimized for fast, community-driven tokens. Unlike chaotic pump-style platforms that rely on hype alone, O-Pump integrates **smart tokenomics, liquidity locks, and verified developer protections**, all powered by a dynamic pricing system called **Power Ramp**.

This makes O-Pump the **only stealth launch system that combines hype with actual protocol safety** — ideal for meme coins, viral experiments, and fast-moving creator projects.

#### 🔁 Power Ramp Pricing Model

_Dynamic price scaling based on token demand._

O-Pump uses a smart curve called **Power Ramp** to calculate price during minting, ensuring early buyers pay less and later buyers drive up the floor.

**Formula:**

Price(s)=P0+k⋅(sSmax)2\text{Price}(s) = P₀ + k \cdot \left(\frac{s}{S\_{max\}}\right)^2Price(s)=P0​+k⋅(Smax​s​)2

Where:

* **P₀** = Initial token price
* **k** = Curve steepness
* **s** = Tokens sold
* **Sₘₐₓ** = Total sale cap

This exponential ramp rewards early entries while preventing infinite inflation.

#### 💡 Token Economics

| Parameter           | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Supply**    | Fixed cap (e.g., 1.2M tokens)                        |
| **Sale Allocation** | Portion allocated to O-Pump buyers (e.g., 1M tokens) |
| **Fee Model**       | Protocol fee on SOL/ETH goes to DAO treasury         |
| **LP Lock**         | Liquidity is auto-locked or burned post-migration    |

#### 🚀 Sale & Migration Mechanism

1. **Initialization**\
    Admin sets `P₀`, `k`, supply cap, and launches mint program via `initialize()`
2. **Buy Phase**\
    Users call `buy(quantity)` with SOL/ETH\
    Tokens are minted at current Power Ramp price
3. **Auto Migration Trigger**\
    At threshold (e.g., 20% sold), `migration()` deploys LP pool\
    LP is locked or burned — no chance for rugpulls
4. **Verified Projects**\
    Super projects are marked as _“Verified Developers”_, meaning:\
    - Known deployers\
    - Clean contracts\
    - Active teams\
    These are featured higher in leaderboards and show trust tags

#### 🔒 Security & Authority Logic

| Component             | Role                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authority PDA**     | Stores admin Pubkey; only it can execute privileged actions |
| **update\_owner()**   | Allows secure ownership transfer (no private key exposure)  |
| **Liquidity Locking** | All LP tokens are either timelocked or burned               |
| **Buyer UX**          | Auto-initializes token accounts with SOL/ETH purchases      |

✅ Built with the **Anchor framework**\
✅ u128 math for fixed-point exponential pricing\
✅ Emits `InitializeEvent`, `BuyEvent`, and `MigrationEvent` for analytics tracking
