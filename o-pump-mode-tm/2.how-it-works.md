# 2.How It Works

_Launch your token in minutes. No code. No middlemen. Just pure on-chain action._

O-Pump Mode™ offers a lightning-fast, fully on-chain launch experience that lets you **mint, sell, and list a token in one flow**. Everything is powered by the **Power Ramp pricing engine**, with built-in liquidity migration and verification options to protect buyers.

***

#### 🧱 1. Create Your Token

_One form. One click. One chain._

To start:

* Enter a **Token Name** (e.g. DogePump)
* Set a **Symbol** (e.g. DGP)
* Upload your project image
* Pay the mint fee (e.g., \~0.02 SOL)

Once confirmed, your token is live and eligible for Power Ramp sale.

✅ No Solidity or Rust required\
✅ Instantly deploys on Solana\
✅ Image + metadata auto-linked

#### ⚡ 2. Enter the Power Ramp

_Let the curve drive the FOMO._

The moment your token goes live, users can begin buying through the **Power Ramp model**, which automatically increases the price based on how much supply has been sold.

**Pricing Formula:**

Price(s)=P0+k⋅(sSmax)2\text{Price}(s) = P₀ + k \cdot \left(\frac{s}{S\_{max\}}\right)^2Price(s)=P0​+k⋅(Smax​s​)2

Where:

* **P₀** = Starting price
* **k** = Curve steepness
* **s** = Supply sold
* **Sₘₐₓ** = Total tokens for sale

Early users get lower prices. Late buyers push the floor higher.

✅ No hard caps or fixed pricing\
✅ On-chain enforcement with no admin intervention\
✅ Fees routed to the DAO treasury

#### 🚀 3. Automatic Pool Creation

_Real listing. Real liquidity. No rugs._

When the sale hits a predefined threshold (e.g., 20% sold), the contract triggers a **migration event**:

* A trading pair is created on-chain
* Liquidity is added automatically
* LP tokens are **locked or burned**, making the listing trustless

✅ Trading starts immediately\
✅ No human delay or rug risk\
✅ Token moves from sale → market seamlessly

***

#### 📊 4. Live Stats, Leaderboards & Trading

Once live, your project appears on:

* **Top Tokens** board (sorted by volume, holders, or floor)
* **Hype Leaderboard** (measured by velocity and social buzz)
* **Recent Trades** feed (real-time trade logs)
* **Power Curve Chart** (mock/live charting view)

Buyers can:

* Interact through token pages
* Track wallet distribution and liquidity
* View verified status and badges if applicable
