# 2.Error Handling

_Reliability backed by safeguards, transparency, and fallback logic._

While OPPAD is built to be secure and robust, errors may occasionally occur due to blockchain congestion, third-party service disruptions, or user misconfiguration. This section outlines how the platform detects, handles, and communicates these issues.

***

#### üß± Platform-Level Error Handling

**Frontend / Dashboard Errors:**

* Network status is monitored and shown via UI alerts
* Failed transactions prompt **clear, user-friendly messages**
* Retry logic is implemented for key API requests and blockchain calls
* Auto-refresh mechanisms detect outdated chain state or unsynced wallets



***

#### üîê Smart Contract Error Handling

All OPPAD smart contracts are designed with:

* **Input validation**: Rejects invalid token addresses, zero values, or unapproved logic
* **Non-reentrant functions**: To avoid double-execution or draining vulnerabilities
* **Try/catch & fallback conditions**: For integrations with other protocols
* **Fail-safe withdrawals**: EmergencyWithdraw or refund functions exist for staking/farming contracts

{% hint style="success" %}
Any failed interaction due to contract logic (e.g., staking before approval) is **reverted on-chain** and does not consume funds, except for gas.
{% endhint %}

***

#### üö® Error Reporting Flow

If an error is triggered:

1. UI displays a toast or modal with error type (e.g., `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`, etc.)
2. Detailed error logs are recorded in our backend (for dashboard interactions)
3. Users can **report errors** via support form or Discord
4. Critical issues are **hot-patched or mitigated** via admin/multisig when necessary

#### üìã Common Error Categories

| Error Type             | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`   | User lacks enough tokens or ETH/SOL for gas         |
| `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`    | Token not approved for staking/farming interaction  |
| `RPC_TIMEOUT`          | Chain node failed to respond within expected window |
| `TRANSACTION_REVERTED` | Contract logic invalidated the transaction          |
| `NOT_WHITELISTED`      | Address is not part of an exclusive launch pool     |
| `HARVEST_LOCKED`       | User tried to claim rewards before unlock interval  |
