# 1.Legal Compliance

_Operating transparently within evolving global frameworks._

OPPAD is committed to building a secure, transparent, and responsible decentralized launch ecosystem. While the platform is designed to operate without borders or intermediaries, we acknowledge the importance of aligning with key principles of legal compliance—especially in areas such as user protection, financial transparency, and data security.

#### 🧾 KYC & AML Practices

For projects using OPPAD’s KYC service:
