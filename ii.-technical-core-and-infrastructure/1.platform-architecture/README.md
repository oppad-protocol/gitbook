# 1.Platform Architecture

_A secure, modular, and scalable infrastructure for decentralized token launches._

OPPAD is engineered as a fully modular platform combining Web3 interfaces, secure backend logic, and smart contract systems that interact seamlessly across supported chains. The architecture is built for **real-time performance**, **on-chain security**, and **permissionless deployment** â€” enabling anyone to create, audit, launch, and grow tokens with zero technical expertise.

#### ðŸ§± Core Components

The OPPAD architecture is composed of:

* **Frontend** â€“ Interactive launchpad dashboard, wallet integration, and real-time views
* **Backend** â€“ Submission processing, data handling, referral engines, and admin control
* **Smart Contracts** â€“ Launch logic, token creation, liquidity locking, badges, rewards
* **Database Layer** â€“ Secure storage of off-chain metadata (forms, user actions, project info)
* **Multi-chain Support** â€“ Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Base, Sonic

> Every project launched on OPPAD flows through the same structure:\
> Form submission â†’ Dual Review â†’ On-chain deployment â†’ Community participation â†’ Utility rollout (staking, farming, NFTs)
