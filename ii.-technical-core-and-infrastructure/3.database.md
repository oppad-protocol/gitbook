# 3.Database

_Efficient, secure, and scalable off-chain data architecture._

While smart contracts handle all **on-chain logic** (contributions, locks, claims), OPPAD uses a structured database system to manage **off-chain metadata**, enhance user experience, and power admin tools and analytics. The backend is tightly coupled with smart contract events to ensure **synchronization, transparency, and accountability.**

***

#### 🛠️ 1. Architecture Overview

* **Engine**: MySQL / MariaDB
* **Environment**: Hosted on a secure cloud instance with role-based access
* **Access**: Backend services connect via secured queries with sanitation layers

> \[!INFO]\
> The database does **not store any wallet private keys, balances, or sensitive funds.** All critical logic is executed via smart contracts.

#### 📦 2. Stored Data Categories

| Table Name          | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `projects`          | General info (name, chain, category, logo, status) |
| `applications`      | Multi-step launch form entries                     |
| `vesting_schedules` | TGE %, unlock intervals, unlock rates              |
| `users`             | Wallets linked to tasks, rewards, staking          |
| `referrals`         | Referral invites, tracking, reward claims          |
| `audit_results`     | AI + manual findings per project                   |
| `badges`            | KYC, audit, trust, and lock status records         |
| `analytics`         | Project KPIs, TVL tracking, launch performance     |

#### 🔄 3. Live Sync with Smart Contracts

* When users submit a form:\
   - Data is stored in `applications`\
   - Admins trigger review flow
* When a launch goes live:\
   - On-chain events trigger `projects` table update\
   - Contract addresses, token info, and claim status are updated
* Vesting and farming logic:\
   - Reads on-chain state and combines it with off-chain metadata (e.g. image, description)

***

> \[!TIP]\
> The database ensures that even if the user is on mobile or using a slow RPC, they still get **fast-loading dashboards** with real-time progress, token info, and eligibility checks.

***

#### 🔒 4. Security Controls

* SQL injection prevention and data sanitation
* Input validation and data length checks
* Admin activity logs and change tracking
* Backup strategy and restore snapshots

***

> \[!WARNING]\
> Direct database access is restricted to backend services and internal roles — **no client-side interaction is permitted.**
