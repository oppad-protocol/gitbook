# 4.Dual Review Mechanism

_Every project is checked twice — by AI and by humans — before it ever goes live._

OPPAD introduces a unique two-layer security framework that combines the **speed of automation** with the **depth of human expertise**, ensuring that no malicious or flawed contract slips through the cracks. This is not a cosmetic process — it is a **core protocol rule** that all projects must pass, regardless of who submits them or what capital they bring.

At the heart of this system lies our **AegisAI™ engine**, a custom-built AI audit module trained to detect the most common — and most dangerous — smart contract exploits. It runs a comprehensive scan on submitted tokens, flagging potential risks such as:

* Reentrancy vulnerabilities
* Unlimited mint functions
* Backdoor ownership transfers
* Malicious taxation code
* Honeypot traps
* Function obfuscation

Once the AI audit is complete, every project moves to the **Sentinel Manual Review**, a human-led inspection process that analyzes the contract from a logical and architectural standpoint. Sentinel doesn't just look at what the contract _can_ do — it evaluates whether what it does aligns with the declared tokenomics and public-facing promises. This protects the community from misleading designs, unverified claims, and subtle trust exploits.

> This dual system ensures **code-level, logic-level, and intent-level analysis** — stopping honeypots, hidden fees, infinite mints, and malicious ownership traps.\
> It’s not about passing an audit — it’s about proving integrity at the protocol level.

By enforcing this system at launch level, OPPAD creates a **trustless framework** where no team can bypass review, no badge can be faked, and no investor is left in the dark. The result? A launch environment where transparency isn’t optional — it’s hardcoded.
