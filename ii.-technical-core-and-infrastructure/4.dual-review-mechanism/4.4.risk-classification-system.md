# 4.4.Risk Classification System

_A standardized way to grade smart contract threats and transparency gaps._

To ensure clarity for both investors and developers, OPPAD uses a **tiered risk classification system** during the review process. This system applies to **both AegisAI™ and Sentinel Review**, helping categorize the severity of issues found in a project’s smart contracts or configuration.

***

> \[!INFO]\
> This system is not just for backend scoring — **risk levels are visible on the project dashboard** and determine badge status, launch eligibility, and user alerts.

#### 🎯 Risk Tiers

| Risk Level     | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Pass**     | No critical or major issues. Ready to launch with full audit badge.         |
| ⚠️ **Warning** | Non-critical risks or questionable design choices. Requires flag or notice. |
| ❌ **Critical** | Serious flaws, malicious patterns, or undeclared behavior. Launch blocked.  |

***

#### 🧠 Risk Evaluation Factors

Risk is classified based on a combination of:

* **Exploitability**: Can the issue be used to harm users or drain funds?
* **Stealth**: Is the logic hidden or intentionally obfuscated?
* **Mismatch**: Does the contract contradict declared tokenomics or features?
* **Repeat Patterns**: Does the contract resemble known scams or rug templates?
* **Centralization Risk**: Can the dev or owner pause, blacklist, or mint arbitrarily?

***

#### 🔄 Cross-Layer Consistency

* AegisAI™ assigns a **numerical score (0–100)** with thresholds for Warning and Critical.
* Sentinel reviewers **confirm, override, or elevate** the AI-assigned risk based on human logic.
* Final classification is **stored on-chain** and reflected in the badge system.

> \[!WARNING]\
> Even a project that passes AegisAI™ can be **downgraded to Critical** by Sentinel if manual logic review reveals deception or unlisted features.
