# 4.2.Sentinel Review (Manual Process)

_Human logic > smart tricks._

**Sentinel Review** is the second and final checkpoint in OPPAD’s Dual Review system. Once a project passes the AegisAI™ scan, it is sent to the **Sentinel Team**, where experienced smart contract analysts manually verify the intent, structure, and behavior of the submitted token and launch logic.

#### 🔍 What We Check

The Sentinel team goes beyond surface-level code and performs:

* ✅ **Logic Flow Analysis**\
   - Ensures the token behaves as claimed\
   - Detects misleading fee or burn models\
   - Confirms functions are called in correct order
* 📚 **Dependency Review**\
   - Evaluates imported libraries, forks, and token templates\
   - Flags known scam templates or libraries with weak inheritance
* 🧾 **Tokenomics Matching**\
   - Verifies that on-chain code matches what’s declared in the application form\
   - Ensures vesting, decimals, limits, and supply caps are consistent
* 🛑 **Hidden Backdoors**\
   - Owner-only functions\
   - Emergency withdrawals\
   - Undisclosed token blacklists\
   - Hidden mints or trading locks

#### 🧠 Human Judgment = Context + Experience

* Sentinel doesn’t just flag errors — it **explains the risk**, documents it, and may approve with warnings if intent is clear.
* If the project is safe but unclear, the team **suggests optimizations** or best practices.

#### 📝 Outcome

Every Sentinel audit ends with one of three results:

| Result         | Meaning                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Pass**     | Project is safe and ready to launch             |
| ⚠️ **Warning** | Risky behavior detected, but team justified it  |
| ❌ **Reject**   | Critical risk found; launch blocked until fixed |

Projects can **resubmit for review** after remediation. The review history is recorded and visible to the OPPAD admin panel for transparency.
