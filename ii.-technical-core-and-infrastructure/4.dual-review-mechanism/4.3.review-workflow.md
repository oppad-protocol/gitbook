# 4.3.Review Workflow

_From submission to security-verified launch._

Every project submitted to OPPAD goes through a **strict, sequential audit pipeline**. The review workflow ensures no project can bypass validation, pay to be approved, or hide behind fake badges.

***

#### 🧭 Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Project Submitted**\
    - Dev fills the application\
    - Token and launch logic uploaded
2. **AegisAI™ Audit Triggered**\
    - Contract scanned instantly\
    - Issues flagged in <5 mins\
    - Score + risk level recorded
3. **If Passed → Go to Sentinel**\
    - If Critical: Blocked\
    - If Warning: Sent for explanation
4. **Sentinel Review Begins**\
    - Human auditors inspect logic\
    - Match declared tokenomics vs code\
    - Check dependencies and forks
5. **Final Review Outcome**\
    - ✅ Pass = Audit Badge\
    - ⚠️ Warning = Soft flag + Badge\
    - ❌ Reject = Launch blocked
6. **Results Published**\
    - Audit score and badge displayed on frontend\
    - Stored on-chain for transparency

#### 🔁 Resubmission Support

Projects that fail any stage may:

* View their audit logs
* Fix issues
* **Resubmit once** for re-review

> \[!TIP]\
> Multiple failed attempts will flag the project internally and lock its form.

***

#### 🧾 What Makes It Different?

* 🛑 **Unskippable**: All projects must pass both layers
* 💵 **Unbribable**: No paid audits or skip tokens
* 🔍 **Verifiable**: Review data stored off-chain + verified badge stored **on-chain**

> \[!INFO]\
> This process ensures only **credible, secure, and honest projects** are launched through OPPAD.
