# 4.1.AegisAI™ (AI Reviewer Engine)

_Fast. Consistent. Unbiased._

**AegisAI™** is OPPAD’s custom-built AI scanner that runs advanced static analysis on every token submitted to the platform. It is the **first line of defense**, designed to detect contract-level vulnerabilities and malicious code patterns **within minutes** of submission — long before the project reaches the public dashboard.

***

#### 🚀 What It Detects

AegisAI™ analyzes smart contracts using a combination of open-source audit engines (like Slither and MythX) and OPPAD’s proprietary heuristics. It identifies:

* 🔒 Honeypot behavior (where you can buy but not sell)
* ⚠️ Hidden mint or unlimited supply functions
* 🧨 Blacklisting logic (blocking wallets from transfers)
* 🔁 Reentrancy vulnerabilities
* 🧬 Malicious fee-routing or tax manipulation
* 🧾 Obfuscated function names or dead code
* 🔧 Unauthorized contract ownership transfers

{% hint style="danger" %}
A project flagged by AegisAI™ cannot proceed to the manual audit until issues are resolved or explained.
{% endhint %}

***

#### 🧠 How It Works

1. The developer submits the token during application.
2. AegisAI™ runs a full scan in under 5 minutes.
3. A numerical **risk score** is generated (0–100).
4. Risk flags are assigned:\
    - ✅ Passed\
    - ⚠️ Warning\
    - ❌ Critical
5. The output is stored on-chain and forwarded to the Sentinel team for secondary analysis.

***

{% hint style="success" %}
AegisAI™ is trained on over **1,000+ historical exploit cases**, including REKT leaderboard data, forked scam contracts, and verified audit reports — enabling it to catch even the most subtle red flags.
{% endhint %}

#### 📦 Results Are Stored

* Each result is saved in the backend and tied to the project’s badge record.
* Review data is made public for transparency.
* Results cannot be modified or hidden by the team — ensuring full credibility.
