# 2.Security Measures

_Built-in protections to eliminate risks and enforce trust from Day 0._

Security is not an afterthought in OPPAD — it is embedded in every layer of the platform. From token creation to liquidity locks, from auditing to farming, OPPAD implements **preventive**, **detective**, and **corrective security measures** to safeguard both users and builders.

***

#### 🔍 1. **Dual Review System** (Pre-launch Audit Enforcement)

All projects are reviewed by two independent layers:

* **AegisAI™** – AI-driven smart contract scanner to detect:\
   - Honeypots, infinite mint, overflows, blacklisting logic, etc.
* **Sentinel Review** – Manual review team checks:\
   - Contract logic, dependencies, library calls, hidden functions

{% hint style="warning" %}
Projects cannot proceed to launch unless both layers pass or resolve issues — badges are issued on-chain.
{% endhint %}

***

#### 🔐 2. **OPPADLock – Liquidity Enforcement**

* Every project must define lock duration for LP and team tokens
* LP tokens are **automatically locked** through OPPADLock smart contract
* Unlock timestamps are publicly visible in the dashboard

#### 🚫 3. **Anti-Bot & Sniper Protection**

* O-Pump Mode™ includes:\
   - Pre-block time delay\

   - Standards-compliant (ERC-20)\
   - Checked for:\
    - Hidden mint\
    - Ownership misdirection\
    - Malicious fee routing
* Metadata is validated on submission

{% hint style="danger" %}
Custom tokens imported manually are flagged and require full audits.
{% endhint %}

#### 🧑‍💼 5. **KYC, Doxxing & Identity Assurance**

* Teams can choose to:\
   - KYC with an approved partner\
   - Upload doxxed team info
* KYC’d projects receive a **badge**
* Badge is stored on-chain and visible to all users

***

#### 🧾 6. **Badge System for Transparency**

* Badges include:\
   ✅ KYC Passed\
   🔒 Locked Liquidity\
   🔍 Audited (AI & Manual)\
   🚀 Verified Launch
* Badge states are **on-chain** and tamper-proof
