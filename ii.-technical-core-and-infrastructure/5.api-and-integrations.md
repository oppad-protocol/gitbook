# 5.API & Integrations

_Connecting builders, tools, and partners to the OPPAD ecosystem._

OPPAD offers a flexible and secure API layer that allows external applications, dashboards, and partners to interact with key platform data. This enables real-time integrations with analytics tools, audit partners, aggregators, and project management systems — while preserving the decentralized nature of launch execution.

#### 📡 Available API Endpoints

OPPAD’s RESTful API provides public and protected access to core datasets:

| `/projects/:id/audit`     | Returns AegisAI™ and Sentinel audit results         |
| `/vesting/:project_id`    | Fetch vesting schedule for a given token            |
| `/badges/:project_id`     | Returns badge states (KYC, Audit, Lock, Trusted)    |
