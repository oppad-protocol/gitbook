# 4.Revenue Sharing

_Community-powered economics. Earn from every success._

The **OPPAD Revenue Sharing Module** redistributes a portion of platform revenue back to its ecosystem—**stakers, NFT PASS holders, referrers, and ambassadors**—on a fixed, bi-weekly schedule. It ensures that as OPPAD grows, so do its most loyal contributors.

***

#### 📌 1. What is Revenue Sharing?

Revenue Sharing ensures a portion of **all platform income** is automatically sent back to participants who fuel the system—whether by staking, holding an NFT PASS, or promoting launches.

It transforms passive users into **economic partners**.
