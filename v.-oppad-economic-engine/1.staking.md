# 1.Staking

_Stake, earn, and unlock deeper rewards with $OP._

The OPPAD staking dashboard allows any token project — including those launched via O-Pump — to create a secure, on-chain staking pool. Users can lock tokens to earn rewards, access NFT tiers, and qualify for ecosystem benefits.

***

#### 🔧 1. Deploy Your Staking Contract

Project owners can launch a staking contract directly from the dashboard:

**Required fields:**

* Token address
* Token name
* Token symbol

Once deployed, your staking pool becomes visible in the **Available Staking Pools** section for all users.

#### 📊 2. Staking Dashboard Components

| **Component**          | **Description**                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deploy Interface**   | Input form to deploy a custom staking pool           |
| **Total Value Locked** | Total $OP or token staked across all active pools    |
| **APY**                | Yield percentage per lock period                     |
| **Number of Stakers**  | Active users in the pool                             |
| **Balance Panel**      | User’s token balance and approval status             |
| **Staked Amount**      | User’s current locked amount and earned rewards      |
| **Claim Panel**        | Button to withdraw staking rewards after lock expiry |
| **Available Pools**    | Public list of all active staking pools              |

#### ⏳ 3. Staking Options & Mechanics

| Lock Duration | APY | Early Unstake Fee |
| ------------- | --- | ----------------- |
| 30 Days       | 10% | 23%               |
| 60 Days       | 20% | 23%               |
| 90 Days       | 30% | 23%               |
| 120 Days      | 45% | 23%               |

* **Lock Period**: The minimum time before penalty-free unstaking
* **Early Unstake Fee**: Fixed 23% fee if withdrawn before maturity
* **Re-locking**: Extends the lock period with new terms
* **Status Indicator**: “Locked” or “Unlocked” shown based on timestamp

> \[!TIP]\
> All staking is on-chain. Rewards accrue per block and can be claimed anytime after unlock.

#### 🧭 4. How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask or WalletConnect
2. **Choose Pool & Duration**: Select any available staking pool
3. **Enter Amount**: Input token amount and approve contract
4. **Stake**: Confirm the transaction to lock tokens
5. **Claim**: After lock expiry, claim earned rewards (in $OP or stablecoins)

#### 🧱 5. Tier-Based NFT Access (Crystal Cards)

| Tier         | Minimum Stake | Lock Period | NFT Reward       |
| ------------ | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **Copper**   | $1,000        | 30 Days     | 🟢 Copper Card   |
| **Platinum** | $3,500        | 60 Days     | 🔵 Platinum Card |
| **Diamond**  | $10,000       | 90 Days     | 🟠 Diamond Card  |

**NFT Benefits:**

* 🔁 Revenue share multipliers
* 🪩 Private early access to new launches
* 🎟️ Event & airdrop eligibility
* 🧩 Governance perks (future upgrade)

#### ⚙️ 6. Smart Contract Overview

| Function             | Purpose                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `stake()`            | Locks user tokens for selected duration        |
| `unstakeEarly()`     | Allows early exit with 23% fee                 |
| `claimRewards()`     | Withdraws earned APY after lock ends           |
| `calculateRewards()` | Uses: `stakedAmount × APY × timeElapsed` logic |

Built with:

* ✅ Solidity + OpenZeppelin standards
* ✅ Time-based APY accrual
* ✅ Transparent reward distribution via events
